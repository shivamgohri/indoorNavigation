- **Feature 1 : Received Signal Strength Based Indoor Positioning**  
Our app utilizes the strength of the received signal to obtain the usersâ€™ position. This feature allows the user to precisely navigate to a specific person who is connected to the hotspot of his mobile using wifi and can be used when there are a lot of people in a given area eg. in a hall , places with multiple counters etc.

- **Feature 2 : Pressure Value Based Altitude Positioning**  
The value of the pressure sensor (already present in our smart phones) is used to accurately measure the altitude at which the device currently is. This feature helps in determining the floor at which the user is.
